## Synopsis

The project represents an analysis of the Bilgewater-Event from League of Legends. We took a look at the influence of the stronger Minions and new Items on the game. The project contains a program for downloading the needed match data from the Riot API, a program for analysing the data and preparing it for presentation in web and a web application presenting the data.
The application is localised in 9 languages. But all but english and german a translated with google. We just wanted to show, how easy a proper localisation can be made with an ASP.NET project.
